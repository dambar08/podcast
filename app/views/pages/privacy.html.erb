  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Podcast - Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Podcast provides the Podcast product (<a href="https://www.podcast.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">www.podcast.com</a>) and Podcast Ads (<a href="https://www.podcast.com/ads" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">www.podcast.com/ads</a>), together referred to as the Podcast Services. Podcast is committed to protecting the privacy and data of those who visit the podcast.com website, use the Podcast Services, and listen to podcast episodes served from Podcast servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The data you put into Podcast is yours. We'll only access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software issue. We log access to accounts by IP address to verify no unauthorized access has occurred while the logs are retained.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Podcast Listener Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Podcast believes protecting online privacy is important and this extends to podcast listeners. When you listen to a podcast served directly from Podcast's servers, your privacy is respected. Podcast only collects minimal data necessary to validate a download, understand the application initiating the download, and get a general sense of the download’s geographic location.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Podcast does NOT use listener data to:</strong></p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li>Programmatically target advertisements</li>
    <li>Track or identify individuals</li>
    <li>Create interest-based profiles</li>
    <li>Combine data to associate audience demographics</li>
    <li>Sell listener data to any party</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Data Collected from Third-Party Channels</h3>
  <p>
    When podcast episodes are downloaded through third-party channels, listener data recorded includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li>IP Address</li>
    <li>User Agent</li>
    <li>Referring URL (in some cases)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data comes from server logs. Podcast does not, by default, use third-party tracking technologies on media downloads.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Why We Collect Listener Data</h3>
  <p>
    Podcast collects listener data only to:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
    <li>Provide anonymized statistics to customers</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal behavior</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Sub-Processors Agreements</h2>
  <p>
    To optimize performance and redundancy, some listener traffic is routed through AWS CloudFront and Cloudflare networks. They have access to the same basic listener data as Podcast. Their privacy policies align with Podcast’s values. Relevant links:
